The expected deliverable is a mergeable pull request towards https://github.com/openstreetmap/openstreetmap-website. It must implement the changes to the website and API related to the privacy of user accounts in  the [GDPR Position Paper](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/w/images/8/88/GDPR_Position_Paper.pdf) and [list of affected services](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/GDPR/Affected_Services).

The LWG are asked to review recent changes to the website relating to anti-vandalism measures and other issues.
