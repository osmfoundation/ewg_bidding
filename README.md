# Engineering Working Group Bid Repository

This is the Engineering Working Group's repository for accepting project funding proposals. If you are here to make a project funding proposal, please skip to the next section. If you would like to learn more about OpenStreetMap and the Engineering Working Group (EWG), you can check out the wiki page [here](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Engineering_Working_Group).

## Project Funding Process

Project funding proposals are made as pull requests on Github against this repository. Before making your funding proposal, please acquaint yourself with the project funding process described in the following document:

* [The Project Funding Framework](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Engineering_Working_Group/Project_Funding_Framework)

## Submitting your proposal

Proposals should go in the `/proposals` folder for the corresponding project. Proposals should be structured as a single README doc alongside any other assets contained in a folder with your name (or Github username if you prefer) and the date of your PR, i.e. `/john_smith-DD-MM-YYYY`.

Should you have any questions about the EWG, the funding process, or your proposal, please contact us at [engineering@osmfoundation.org](mailto:engineering@osmfoundation.org).
